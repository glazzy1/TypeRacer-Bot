# TypeRacer-Bot
Automatically types for you on typeracer.com — without Selenium.

## Information
This tool was developed to demonstrate how straightforward it is to automate/cheat on a service like TypeRacer. This uses image recognition and not Selenium unlike my old TypeRacer script. Usage of this tool increases chances to win; especially by selecting the "Pro" or "Hacker" speed. It is 100% accurate and does not mistype. Please refrain from using this bot as it was developed for educational purposes only. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk — it is against TypeRacer's Terms of Service. You have been warned.

It works in public, as well as private matches with friends.

## Usage
- Python 3.6 or above is required.
- I develop for Windows machines only and do not intentionally support other operating systems.
- If you do not already have the **PyAutoGUI** library installed, run setup.py — make sure PIP is added to PATH.

Public matches:
1. Run main.py.
2. Select the desired speed.
3. Visit [play.typeracer.com](https://play.typeracer.com).
4. Launch any HTTP debugger — built-in browser debuggers work. In this example, I am going to use Chrome's built-in debugger.
5. Head over to the [Network tab](https://i.imgur.com/UAzJL0R.png).
6. Click "Enter a typing race" on the website.
7. Click on [this request](https://i.imgur.com/3gdyVdm.png) for further details.
